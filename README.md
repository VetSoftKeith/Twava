*Java wrapper for the Twitch API*

## Project State
This wrapper is still in its infancy and I will continue to work on it in my free time.

## End State
> This wrapper will **NOT** be using Kraken endpoints.  The Kraken API (aka v5) was deprecated by Twitch on August 31, 
2017 and is scheduled for removal on December 31, 2018.

The following Twitch products are planned to be supported as much as possible.  
> NOTE: I have not fully explored each to see if they are usable from a Java CLI environment (mostly looking at you, 
WebHooks).

* Twitch Authentication
* Twitch IRC Chat
* Twitch Helix REST API
* Twitch PubSub WebSocket API
* Twitch WebHooks
